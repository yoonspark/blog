title: purrr package in R
---

One of my great discoveries in this year is `purrr` package in R.  I came across this amazing toolkit while taking a [DataCamp course on writing R functions](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r).  The timing was apt as I was then fitting many different multilevel models for one of my projects at work.  I had thus far heavily relied on `for` loops to achieve this, which made my scripts long and, in hindsight, quite clumsy.  Once I got a sufficient handle on the concept and practice of functional programming, I proceeded to rewrite these scripts in a functional style.  I still remember the pleasant shock I had upon seeing the scripts considerably shortened --- yet they were much more clear and efficient.  True to its promise, functional programming with `purrr` has allowed me to focus on *what* I intend to achieve rather than on *how* I can achieve it.  R already has `apply` family of functions, but functions in `purrr` are more consistent and clear on what they do.  Plus, `purrr` has been designed by those same people who have created `ggplot2` and `dplyr`, which means that the package works harmoniously with these other jewels of R programming and that it will be well maintained and continually developed in coming years.  For those who want concrete examples of what the package offers, I recommend two great resources:

* [R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html)
* [Tutorial by Jenny Bryan](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/)
